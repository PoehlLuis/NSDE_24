# We set:
#   - Dirichlet Boundary conditions on the left with value 0
#   - Dirichlet Boundary conditions on the right with value 9
#   - Upper and lower bounds have values [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
#   - No line in the middle

# Result should be a linear function from left to right with increasing temperature

# In the csv-file we write:
#   - the coordinates of each node
#   - the calculated value for each node
#   - nodes and values are beeing traversed from top left to bottom right 
#     as one reads
